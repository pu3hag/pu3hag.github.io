# High Performance FM CIs

## Reasoning

AirSpy discovery uses ST709R:
> HF+ uses STA709 front-end tuner IC with two Σ∆ ADCs at 36 Msps, which are an equivalent to direct sampling at 72 Msps. The digital signal is decimated, scaled down and streamed via USB. The output I/Q stream provides 16-bit samples at 768 Ksps rate, but the usable bandwidth is a bit narrower though, up to 660 kHz.

A colleague mentioned in a .RO forum: 

> there have been even more efficient but very complex mixer solutions ( details ), commercially implemented only in chips for FM receivers (eg: STA710, TDA7786M etc) for the time being
