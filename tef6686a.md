# Anotações soltas sobre o CI NXP TEF6686 para aplicação de DX em VHF FM broadcast (88-108MHz)

## NXP SAF7751 and TEF6686: CIs usados em auto-rádios modernos com ótimo desempenho em FM: 

Neste fio, um colega da China 'eggplant886' explica sua preferência pelos chip da NXP (Philips) 

> For sensitivity and selectivity,I prefer SAF7751 and TEF6686. The former one is a single tuner, offers a high end feature set such as Channel Equalizer and Multipath improvement. SAF7751 is the most advanced receiver ever used in car tuners, this one supports more features such as FM phase diversity which utilizes two antennas at the same time.Further more,the advanced Improved phase diversity algorithm could be used for better performance which requires firmware update.

## Sony XDR-F1HD and XDR-S3HD: receptores para DX em FM sem necessidade de modificações

Todd Emslie publicou uma anaálise e concluiu assim sua avaliação da linhas XDR da Sony:

> With the introduction of the new Sony XDR-F1HD and XDR-S3HD DSP FM tuners, IF selectivity / audio fidelity performance has reached a pinnacle. For many DXers, portable radios, ceramic filter tuner modifications and most other available tuners will be largely uneccesary. However, ceramic IF filter modifications are still useful with high performance tuners such as the Onkyo T-9090 II and Kenwood KT-6040. Serious DX installations usually incorporate a range of receivers and tuners for specific requirements. The Sony XDR FM tuner series will be an important component of any serious DX installation.
> 
> The XDR-S3HD is likely the best tuner available anywhere for serious DX work, while the XDR-F1HD comes second. With the XDR-S3HD, Sony have incorporated the world's best tuner with a rotary tuning dial, volume control, internal speaker, and external power transformer.
